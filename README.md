#Healthcare Cost Prediction Project Summary
#Overview:
This project aims to predict healthcare costs for individuals based on various demographic and lifestyle factors using statistical analysis techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region, the project explores the relationships between these variables and medical insurance charges.

#Key Features:
Utilizes association analysis to identify significant correlations between predictors and healthcare charges.
Implements regression analysis to model the relationships between individual predictors and medical insurance costs.
Employs advanced techniques like backward elimination and Random Forest regression to refine predictive models and enhance accuracy.
Evaluates model performance through Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) comparison and validation testing.
#Findings:
Age, BMI, and smoking status emerge as significant predictors of healthcare charges, with smoking status showing the most substantial impact.
The Random Forest regression model demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to traditional linear regression approaches, with lower RMSE indicating better accuracy.
#Conclusion:
The findings of this project offer valuable insights for healthcare planning, insurance pricing, and individual decision-making. By leveraging data-driven approaches, stakeholders can make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance understanding of factors influencing healthcare costs.
